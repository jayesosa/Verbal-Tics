Two roads um diverged in a yellow uh wood,
And sorry I um could not travel um both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down uh one as far as I could
To where um it um bent in the undergrowth; 

Then took like the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better you know claim
Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
Though like as for um that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And uh both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step like had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day! 
Yet uh knowing how way like leads on to way
I doubted if I uh should ever come back.

I shall um be telling this um with a sigh
Somewhere ages like and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
I took the one less traveled by,
And that uh has made all the um difference.
